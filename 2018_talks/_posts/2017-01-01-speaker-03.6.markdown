description: "You know about the == operator, and the === operator too. They’re great for comparing strings and numbers. But have you heard about Object.is()? Did you know it can give results different from ===? What’s negative zero? Why is 0.1 + 0.2 not equal to 0.3? How do you go about comparing maps and objects and buffers and arrays?

This talk goes into the nitty gritty of JavaScript value types and how to compare them.

I’ll cover value types in JavaScript:

Primitives, e.g. numbers & strings
Objects, e.g. objects, but also arrays, sets, weak maps, typed arrays, etc
Boxed types (Object(42))
I’ll cover how these values can be compared to each other through ==, === and Object.is(). I’ll discuss the (legacy) quirks around typeof.

I’ll discuss how seemingly weird numbers are in JavaScript. It doesn’t help that they’re actually floats, resulting in 0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3. I’ll explain why Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER + 2 === Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER + 1. And why there is a negative zero, and why NaN !== NaN. There’ll be a brief aside for the BigInt proposal and a quick reference of other proposals for fixing numbers.

Finally I’ll talk about deep value comparisons and why immutability is so important for building modern frontends."
