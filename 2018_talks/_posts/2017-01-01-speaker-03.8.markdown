title: Peter Heard
name: Building Scalable React Native Apps
time: 13:30 - 14:00
description: We all want our apps to scale right? Then why do we face the same problems building JavaScript apps that we were facing over a decade ago using .net? We are told that the React architecture will somehow save us like the emperors new clothes, we throw in fancy add ons like Redux but eventually we always end up with a mess. Designing flexible software hasn’t really changed. And by focussing on the frameworks it takes us away from the single most important thing; to separate the framework from our code! In this talk Pete will take you through a journey of building a modern mobile app using React Native and Redux. We will see how to apply the principles of Agile Craftsmanship to build a system of metaphorically designed software with loosely coupled tests which actually make sense even to the casual observer. Begin to refactor your code with ease as we step into a better paradigm for handling our React Native apps like a boss! We will discover&#58; - how to write cross platform code which can be used in React Native and React Web (or any other Single Page App for that matter) - how to ‘deal' with Redux and where it lives - how YOU can use React so it doesn’t USE you - how to apply dependency management across architectural boundaries such as HTTP or the device specific storage - and the elephant in the room… yes! you do need an Inversion Of Control container in JS apps!
