topic: The era of Conversation
description: "<p>We’re entering a promising new era of computing. The advance of  machine learning and artificial intelligence is reviving interest in conversational interfaces. This creates the potential for conversation as the new mode of interaction with technology.</p>

<p>The big problem, recognizing spoken input has been  mostly solved, but a new challenge has arisen: how to build a user  experience that’s modeled after natural human conversation.</p>

<p>This talk outlines the basic mechanics of conversation, introduces  core principles to design by, and presents you with a practical UI  to start creating conversational experiences that engage,  delight, and truly help your users.</p>
