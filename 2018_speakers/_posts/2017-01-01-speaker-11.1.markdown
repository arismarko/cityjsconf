topic: How to make pragmatic choices around developer experience vs user experience
description: "As developers we make choices every day such as what framework to use, what tools to use and what browsers to support. All these decisions have a huge impact on both our experience as developers and the users experience when using out sites. Unfortunately these two areas are not aligned so lets have a look at how we can be pragmatic as developers taking into account both our users and developers experiences."
bio: "Jonathan is a Engineering Manager at Beamly, where he focuses on building out and improving the site to offer users the best possible experience.
