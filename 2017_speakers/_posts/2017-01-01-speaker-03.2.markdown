topic: Applying principles of chaos engineering to Serverless
description: The motivation of this talk is to provoke the audience to think about the failure modes that exists in their serverless architecture and how they can discover them early by applying the principles of chaos engineering. Serverless architectures have more inherent chaos and complexity than their serverful counterparts, and, we have less control over their runtime behaviour!
