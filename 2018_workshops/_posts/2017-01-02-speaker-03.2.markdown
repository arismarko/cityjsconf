description: "<div><p>JavaScript has undergone a lot of changes over the last few years. In some respects, the progress is enthusiastically welcomed after such long periods of no progress back in the ES3/ES5 days. But in others, it's blinding and frustrating to feel like there's no way to &quote;keep up&quote; with all the changes.</p> <p>I have news for you: you can't keep up. At least, not in the way we normally think of it. You can't master all these things the moment they hit stage 4 in the TC39 process. That's not practical.</p>
<p>But being familiar with the currents of change as the language ebbs and flows, shifts and evolves, is very important. New features are rarely about adding &quote;shiny toys&quote; and more about improving your ability to cleanly express in code the stuff you're already doing more manually. You need surface-level competency on the leading edge of JS, and you need to be disciplined to roll new stuff into existing code bases incrementally. That's how you &quote;keep up&quote;.</p>In this workshop, we're going to take a brief survey over a broad range of &quote;recent&quote; JS changes, starting with a few big things in ES6, moving in ES2016, ES2017, and now ES2018. This is an opinionated tour through the newest bits of JS that I think help you keep aware of the direction of the language. Topics covered will include: destructuring, template strings, generators/iterators, array-includes, async functions, async iteration, object rest/spread, and more.
